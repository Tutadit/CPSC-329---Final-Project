					Although the offer sounds too good to turn down, it is unfortunately a scam, more specifically, its Smishing. Smishing is a type of phishing and cybersecurity attack that is  carried out through mobile text messaging, also known as SMS phishing. Victims are deceived into giving sensitive information to a disguised attacker.  Lottery companies or any responsible business would not inform a winner of the prizes via text message, or ask you to click a link. 
				</p>
				<p>
					During the Covid-19 pandemic, scammers are looking for various methods to scam people. Some signs of smishing scams are encouraging you to respond right away whether that be through large rewards. Many smishing messages appear to be from trustworthy sources but always be cautious, even if you recognize the organization.
				</p>
				<p>Ways to avoid this:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Check the phone number</li>
					<li>Do not respond</li>
					<li>Intall anti-malware app</li>

					Mr. Blob just sent company money to a scammer! If Mr. Blob paid more attention to the sender address, he would notice that the name of his company email domain was incorrectly spelt. Mr. Blob should have also known that not being able to reach his boss by phone over such an important money transfer is a big red flag! Is his boss even on vacation? It’s always important to look further into these situations, especially when money is involved.

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If you are wary if a message from a company or business is a scam, you can call to confirm if the sender is who they claim to be.</li>

					<li>Inspect links to see if they direct to where you expect. Slight misspellings in company names or non-secure URLs are some indicators that the message is a scam.</li>

        Oh no! You have fallen victim to a scam!

        <p> 
        In this situation, Thomas McKinnings is not an actual representative from the “Save The Children” Charity. Scammers can pose as charities to request donations for relief funds from unsuspecting victims. Always check with the charity directly for the appropriate methods to donate, before giving out any personal information.</p>

	      <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) received about 1.25 million fraud complaints in 2020, it is also estimated that for every 3 people called, 1 of them falls victim to the scam, with an average loss of $1,170. Here are a few tips to better prepare you to deal with scammers.
				</p>
				<p>Ways to avoid this</p>
        <p>DO:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Do put your phone number on Canada’s Do Not Call List (DNCL). It won’t entirely stop spam calls, but it will make them easier to spot because most legitimate telemarketers won’t call you if you’re on the DNCL registry.</li>
					<li>Do put your phone number on Canada’s Do Not Call List (DNCL). It won’t entirely stop spam calls, but it will make them easier to spot because most legitimate telemarketers won’t call you if you’re on the DNCL registry.</li>
					<li>Do hang up on illegal robocalls.</li>
          <li>Do slow down and ask questions of telemarketers. Legitimate businesses and charities will answer questions and give you time to consider a purchase or donation</li>
          <li>Do independently research travel deals, charities or business and investment opportunities you hear about by phone.</li>
				</ul>
        <p>DO NOT:</p>
				<ul> 
					<li>Don’t answer calls from unknown numbers.</li>
					<li>Don’t return one-ring calls from unknown numbers. These may be scams to get you to call hotlines in African and Caribbean countries that have Canada-style three-digit area codes, and you could incur hefty connection and per-minute fees.</li>
					<li>Don’t follow instructions on a prerecorded message, such as “Press 1” to speak to a live operator (it will probably lead to a phishing expedition) or press any key to get taken off a call list (it will probably lead to more robocalls).</li>
          <li>Don’t give personal or financial data, such as your Social Insurance number or credit card account number, to callers you don’t know. If they say they have the information and just need you to confirm it, that’s a trick.</li>
          <li>Don’t pay registration or shipping charges to get a supposed free product or prize. Such fees are ploys to get your payment information.</li>
          <li>Don’t make payments by gift card, prepaid debit card or wire transfer. Fraudsters favor these methods because they are hard to trace.</li>
