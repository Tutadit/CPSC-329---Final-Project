## CPSC 329 Unessay Project:
# "Choose well or be scammed" - Working Title? 
We'll be developing our "choose your own 
adventure" style like game using web development. Web projects
use `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`.

## `HTML` - `H`yper`T`ext `M`atkup `L`anguage

Websites start with `HTML`, it is a markup language, a markup
language is used to *style* text and images in various ways. 
Another example of a markdown language is markdown, file extention
md (This file is a markdown file). 

There are many features of `HTML`, as well as very many 
resources to learn. 

One of my favorite places to learn is 
[w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com), they have examples of
every `HTML` feature, as well as a playground to try them out.
The have [this good introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) to `HTML` to help you
get the feel for it.

https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP

HTML utilizes `CSS` to provide more advanced styling to the 
document.

## `CSS` - `C`ascading `S`tyle `S`heet

We use `CSS` to style our `HTML` in more advanced ways, we do
this by creating stylesheets and importing them to our `HTML` 
document. In our stylesheets we use rules to determine the
style of our `HTML` document.

There are also a lot of resources to learn CSS, and once
again one of my favorites is [w3school's CSS tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css/).

Other good resources:

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/

With HTMl and CSS a lot can be done, we can make really
pretty sites using only HTML and CSS. But we are missing 
a way fo us to create more functionality out of our site,
enter `Js`

## `JS` - `J`ava`S`cript

`JS` is a programming language for the web. It is used to
create functionallity for websites. It has symantic similarities
to Java and other programming languages, as well as it's own
caveats (Although I don't think we'll have much trouble with them
for this project). 

Again we go to w3schools for a good [intro to JS](https://www.w3schools.com/js/DEFAULT.asp)

## Interneting is Hard

There is this great website https://www.internetingishard.com/ where
you can learn `HTML` and `CSS` in a very neatly organized way.


## Google

As always. google proves itself to be the gretest ultimate resource
for all your web development issues.

## JP

I will teach you the basics as we start working on the project,
please feel welcome to ask me anything as I am happy to help.
